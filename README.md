# KellyC-Return-YouTube-Dislikes

Show dislikes on Youtube

Youtube has removed dislike statistics. This extension return this functionality back.

Used combination of API access and restore data by rating metrica data.

Default requests order -> [page data rating meta data] -> [API driver] (can be replaced in extra settings)

# APIs used

- v1.0.0.0-1.1.1.1 used API by <a href="https://returnyoutubedislike.com/"> Return YouTube Dislikes </a> project as alternative channel. <br>
- currently used temporary api through my host catface.ru, implementation based on YouTube apis that will hide dislikes after 13 Dec.

If YouTube completely closes all metadata, planning to give choice of which data source will be used for load data.

Feel free to suggest any other solutions (open databases \ metrics etc.)
